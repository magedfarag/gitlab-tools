Most scores are calculated using weighted averages of multiple factors:

```
Health Score = (Activity×30% + Issues×20% + MRs×20% + Pipelines×20% + Team×10%)
Adoption Score = (Sum of enabled features × 10 points each)
Quality Score = Based on issue density and complexity metrics
Maturity Score = Average of all DevOps dimension scores
```

### Risk Assessment

Risk levels are determined by:
- **Critical**: Immediate action required (security/operational risk)
- **High**: Action required within 1-2 weeks
- **Medium**: Should be addressed within 1 month
- **Low**: Monitor and address during regular maintenance

### Benchmarking
